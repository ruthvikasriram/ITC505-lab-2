    <b>DETECTION OF ANIMALS USING CONVOLUTIONARY NEURAL NETWORKS</b><br>
    Vehicle animal collision is most common incident which causes loss to wild life. This intelligent system helps in reducing the roadkill during the active nocturnal hours. The system uses thermal image processing using the camera mount on the vehicle. It extracts the features of the object in front of the vehicle to detect the animal. The main method used to extract the features of the animals is VGG-16. The features are detected by normalizing the radiometric image and then processed by finding the magnitude and gradient of a pixel. The extracted features are given as an input to the basic deep learning model, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, where binary cross-entropy is used to detect the existence of the object. Thus the animal can be detected.<br>

    <b>OPTIMIZED PERFORMANCE MEDICAL IMAGE CLASSIFICATION WITH DEEP TREE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS</b><br>
    The performance of two popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, Xception-Net and VGG16, for medical image classification tasks. Specifically, we evaluate their performance on two different datasets: the ISIC dataset for skin lesion classification and the CMNIST dataset for histology image classification. For the ISIC dataset, we use Xception-Net to classify different stages of categories. We fine-tune the pre-trained network on a subset of the ISIC dataset and achieve an accuracy of 91.96%. Our results show that Xception-Net is a powerful deep learning model for skin lesion classification and has the potential to be used in clinical settings for aiding dermatologists in the diagnosis of skin cancer. For the CMNIST dataset, we use VGG16 to classify histology images to classify different stages of categories. We fine-tune the pre-trained network on a subset of the CMNIST dataset and achieve an accuracy of 99.76%.<br>
